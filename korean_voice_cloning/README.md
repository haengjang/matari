# Real-Time Korean Voice Cloning
This repository is Korean version of sv2tts. The original model (which was developed by CorentinJ(https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning)) is based on English.
To implement Korean speech on the model, I refer to tail95(https://github.com/tail95/Voice-Cloning). 
I changed some codes to improve convenience in preprocessing(audio and text) and training. Also I converted tensorflow model to pytorch model and fixed some errors.
